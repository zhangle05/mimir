We had been fighting his efforts to persuade the Reagan Administration to impose tariffs on the Japanese memory chips that competed with Intel’s, and we proceeded to get into an extended if civil policy brawl.\n\nThat was vintage Andrew Stephen Grove, as fierce a competitor in political debates as he was in business. He died Monday, at age 79, having helped to build Intel into one of America’s great companies. He is the latest of many business giants who are dying with less recognition than they deserve for creating America’s post-World War II prosperity.\n\nAndy Grove, Intel\'s co-founder and chief executive in Los Altos, California in 2008. ENLARGE\nAndy Grove, Intel\'s co-founder and chief executive in Los Altos, California in 2008.PHOTO: BLOOMBERG NEWS\nGrove won his political battle as the Reagan Administration negotiated a semiconductor cartel with Japan that raised memory-chip prices for a while. But he lost the war thanks to his own business success, as we predicted he would. Intel’s technology breakthrough in more complex microprocessors made the DRAMs of that era a low-priced commodity while Intel drove the innovation that led to the new age of individual computing.\n\nThis was a tremendous business and management achievement for which Grove was named Time magazine’s Man of the Year in 1997. Grove’s appearance on Time’s cover symbolized an era when CEOs were admired for creating jobs and wealth that benefitted everyone. Americans—even some in the media—took pride in U.S. companies that led the world. Now the media elevate politicians and reality-show celebrities, and the country isn’t better for it.\n\nHaving fled Hungary after the failed anti-Soviet uprising of 1956, Grove is also an example of the many immigrants who have driven American capitalism from its earliest decades. Alexander Graham Bell came from Scotland before founding what became AT&T. Robert Goizueta, who ran Coca-Cola during its glory years, immigrated from Cuba. Google co-founder Sergey Brin is from Russia. They show how the U.S. shortchanges itself by indulging bursts of nativist exclusion.\n\nGrove ran Intel as CEO from 1987 to 1998, remaining chairman until 2005, intellectually active as ever. We recall a phone call amid the post-Enron political furor in which he urged us to resist then Senator Joe Biden’s misguided attempt to force non-executive corporate chairmen to sign off on company accounts under threat of criminal sanction. Grove’s point was that this would drive independent voices out of boardrooms, and Mr. Biden failed.\n\nGrove once told us that he loved reading Peter Drucker on management, and he wrote one of the better business memoirs, “Only the Paranoid Survive.” That’s good advice for those who want to avoid complacency, in business or life, from a man who more than repaid America for the great opportunity it offered him.'),(12,'The History and Influence of Andy Grove','admin','2016-08-15 11:52:16','2016-08-15 11:52:16','Richard S. Tedlow discusses his research on Silicon Valley legend Andy Grove and how he altered much more than the chip industry.','Almost fifty years ago, nineteen-year-old Andy Grove stepped off a boat in New York City, a poor immigrant from Hungary who barely escaped Nazi occupation. A decade later he co-founded Intel, the chipmaker that would help invent the PC industry. But Grove was more than a talented engineer. As his biographer Richard S. Tedlow puts it, Grove was \"one of the master managers in the history of American business.\"\n\nA new biography, Andy Grove: The Life and Times of an American, will debut next week, written by Tedlow, the Class of 1949 Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. Tedlow spent several years researching and interviewing Grove, to the point of inhabiting a small cubicle in Intel\'s Santa Clara, California headquarters. Although Grove participated with Tedlow, he did not review the manuscript until it was in print, Tedlow says.\n\nTedlow discusses the book and Grove in this interview. Next week, HBS Working Knowledge will offer a video podcast with Tedlow, as well as a book excerpt.\n\nSean Silverthorne: Why is your book subtitled \"The Life and Times of an American\"?\n\nRichard S. Tedlow: The subtitle highlights the central theme in Grove\'s professional life. His odyssey epitomizes the fulfillment of the American dream. A penniless immigrant from an environment entirely unlike that in the United States comes here and winds up at the center of the industry which is at the center of the future.\n\nGrove was astonished by America. Nobody ever held against him the fact that he is an immigrant. Nor was he held back because he is of Jewish origin. When he graduated first in his engineering class at the City College of New York in 1960, he was quoted in The New York Times to the effect that \"Friends told me that all I needed was ability. Americans don\'t know how lucky they are.\"\n\nQ: You explore in detail his early years growing up a Hungarian Jew who was threatened not only by the Nazis but also by the Soviet invasion of his country. What do you think this upbringing contributed to his development as a man and a leader?\n\nA: I devote a good deal of attention to Grove\'s childhood, boyhood, and youth because I think an appreciation of the first two decades of his life is essential to understanding his development as a manager.\n\nUntil 1945, anti-Semitism placed Grove\'s physical survival at risk. His father\'s mother was killed in Auschwitz, and other members of his (and his wife\'s) extended family lost their lives in the Holocaust and because of the fighting in World War II. In 1944 and especially early in 1945, young Andy was a hunted child.\n\nLife under the Communist regime which followed the Soviet defeat of the Germans Grove came to find hateful. Everything about Communist Hungary elevated the lie at the expense of the truth.\n\nBoth during the Nazi and Communist eras, knowing what really was going on—finding out the actual truth—was more than once a matter of life and death for the Grove family. Think about it. No wonder Grove\'s search for the truth in the business world was so intense, so passionate.\n\nHE HAS AN UNCANNY ABILITY TO ABSTRACT HIMSELF FROM A DECISION IN WHICH HE IS DEEPLY, EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED AND VIEW THE PROBLEM AS AN OUTSIDER WOULD.\nMore than anyone else, Grove created \"Intel culture.\" If you look at some of the principles by which he ran that company, you can see that in an upside-down way, he learned them in Hungary. Everything Intel was, Grove\'s experience in Hungary was not.\n\nHere are a couple of examples. \"Knowledge power\" trumps \"position power.\" It is, in other words, what you know, not what title you have in the organization that matters. \"We argue about issues, not the people who advocate them\" was another of Grove\'s beliefs. Once again, this is the opposite of his experience in Hungary, where people were stapled to the ideas they put forth. If you were stapled to an idea that lost favor in Hungary, it was worth your life.\n\n\"Put common sense on a pedestal,\" says Grove. Once again, the direct opposite of the \"uncommon nonsense\" epitomized by the \"virtual\" cheering at parades and the show trials of Andy\'s youth.\n\nQ: Grove was also a prolific writer on the art and science of business management, including the books Only the Paranoid Survive and High Output Management. How does he stack up as a thinker in this area? Why do you think someone with such a great engineering and technology background became so interested in strategy and the intricacies of running a business?\n\nA: Grove made the transition from technologist to technologist/manager because he had no choice. When Intel was founded in July of 1968, he was employee number three. Employees number one and two, Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, were older than Andy. They were established and well fixed financially. Neither of them liked business management at all.\n\nSo if Intel were going to be managed—and if it were not it was doomed—the responsibility flowed down to employee number three. Grove knew nothing about managing a business and, in his own words, \"I was scared to death. It was terrifying. I literally had nightmares. I was supposed to be director of engineering, but there were so few of us that they made me director of operations.\"\n\nGrove is the ultimate \"autodidact,\" the ultimate self-taught professional. He started at the bottom—\"My first assignment was to get a post office box so we could get literature describing the equipment we couldn\'t afford to buy\"—and worked his way up to the rank of one of the master managers in the history of American business.\n\nWhat Grove learned, he has also taught. This he has done through his course at Stanford\'s Graduate School of Business during the past quarter century, through the half-dozen books and innumerable articles he has written, and through his hundreds of speeches. But most of all, Grove has taught and continues to teach by example. What he has done and what he has communicated have exercised a profound impact on business schools and business executives. This impact will prove lasting.\n\nQ: You note that \"Andy Grove\'s Intel was a pressure cooker.\" Grove\'s management style was intense and demanding, and Intel was not necessarily the most fun place to work. He guided the company through one of the great transitions in tech history, changing a maker of memory chips into a microprocessor powerhouse, but also had failures such as Intel\'s response to the floating point issue. What do you think managers in general can learn from Grove\'s management and leadership?\n\nA: Grove\'s career has innumerable lessons for the business executives of today and tomorrow. But if I had to select one, it would be \"point of view.\" He has an uncanny ability to abstract himself from a decision in which he is deeply, emotionally involved and view the problem as an outsider would.\n\nIt is this ability to view issues that for others would be fraught with emotion in a clinical fashion, which has led to some of his most astute decisions. The devices he employs to disentangle himself from the heat of the moment can be of use to anybody running a business today.\n\nQ: Grove\'s notebooks, which you had access to, are fascinating. Why did he keep such detailed journals and what did you learn from them?\n\nA: I mentioned previously that Grove is an autodidact—a man capable of teaching himself a remarkable variety of new skills. Writing down his thoughts plays an important role in this process of teaching himself. The act of writing contributes an important element of discipline to his thinking.\n\nWhat I learned from those notebooks is that as hard as Grove drove others, he was harder on himself. He is unsparing in self-criticism. He knew that the speed of the gang is the speed of the boss. No faster.\n\nQ: Most of the titans of industry you have studied in the past are deceased. Andy Grove is very much alive. As an historian, what were some of the professional challenges you faced writing about a living legend?\n\nA: The great advantage of being an historian is the perspective provided by the passage of time. You have a frame in which you can place events. The historian is willing to sacrifice, for that priceless asset, immediacy and access. We have a lot of perspective on Napoleon. However, we can\'t ask him or anyone who knew him, or anyone who knew anyone who knew him, any questions.\n\nI took a chance. I decided that for this one time in my professional life I would sacrifice perspective for access. It is not a decision I regret.\n\nAs I observe in the book\'s acknowledgments, I have spent my career at a university the motto of which is Veritas. I tried to provide a truthful, objective account of Andy Grove\'s life and times in this book. However, the reader should be aware that Grove is a magnetic man. It is impossible, for me at least, to have spent as much time with him as I did and to have immersed myself as completely as I did in this project without developing feelings of admiration and affection which must have colored the account to some degree.\n\nQ: How did the idea for the book come about, and how did your personal relationship with Grove evolve over time?\n\nA: I first met Andy Grove when I made a presentation at Intel in 1993, and we stayed in touch in a desultory fashion ever since. Andy believes in \"strategy by speechmaking.\" Because he has a sense of history, he often uses analogies from the past to illustrate his arguments.\n\nI am an historian, so either he or one of his technical assistants would occasionally ask me for examples of past occurrences which might shed light on current events and on the future. During one such e-mail exchange early in 2003, I made a suggestion about a biography.\n\nSpecifically, I wrote that, as Andy approached the end of his chairmanship of Intel\'s board of directors, there was a good chance that someone was going to try to make money off his name by writing a quick and cheap book about him. I suggested that he consider cooperating with an historian who wanted to write a genuine, truthful account of his career which aimed at the highest scholarly standards.\n\nI said that I did not want to write the book. However, I knew everyone who did this kind of work; and I would be happy to select a couple of candidates worthy of the challenge. There would be no charge. My goal was the advancement of knowledge about a key man in a key company in a key industry in a key part of the world.\n\nHis technical assistant forwarded this e-mail to Grove. His immediate response to her was that this was the stupidest idea he had ever heard. A half hour later, he sent her another e-mail asking why I didn\'t want to write the book. That is how it all began.\n\nQ: What are you working on next?\n\nA: I am at work on the centennial history of the Harvard Business School.'),(13,'SHERMAN MILLS FAIRCHILD','admin','2016-08-15 11:52:59','2016-08-15 11:52:59','Robert Noyce was a remarkable man, quite different from the modest Jack Kilby, the co-inventor of the integrated circuit—Noyce was a champion diver, with a doctorate from MIT and a mind so quick that his friends called him “Rapid Robert”.','Robert Noyce was a remarkable man, quite different from the modest Jack Kilby, the co-inventor of the integrated circuit—Noyce was a champion diver, with a doctorate from MIT and a mind so quick that his friends called him “Rapid Robert”. Let\'s cite Tom Wolfe, author of the book \"The Tinkerings of Robert Noyce: How the Sun Rose on the Silicon Valley\": \"With his strong face, his athlete\'s build, and the Gary Cooper manner, Bob Noyce projected what psychologists call the halo effect. People with the halo effect seem to know exactly what they\'re doing and moreover make you want to admire them for it. They make you see the halos over their heads.\"\n\nNoyce\'s nickname was the \"Mayor of Silicon Valley.\" He was one of the very first scientists to work in the area—long before the stretch of California had earned the Silicon valleyname, and he ran two of the companies that had the greatest impact on the silicon industry: Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel.\n\nRobert Norton Noyce was born on December 12th, 1927, in Burlington, Iowa, and matured in several towns in Iowa, mainly in the small town of Grinnell. He was the youngest of three sons of the Rev. Ralph Brewster Noyce (after Donald, born in 1923, and Gaylord, born in 1926). His father (a 1915 graduate of Doane College; Oberlin College, 1920 and Chicago Theological Seminary, 1923) was a clergyman and the associate superintendent of the Congregational Christian Conference of Iowa in the late 1930s and 1940s. His mother, Harriet May Norton, was the daughter of the Rev. Milton Norton and Louise Hill and a 1921 graduate of Oberlin College. She has been described as an intelligent woman with a commanding.\n\nRobert was born into a family with deep Midwestern roots and a tradition of its men serving as teachers and ministers. His father was a descendant of the Governor William Bradford (1590-1657) of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the Mayflower; Elder William Brewster, (1567-1644), the Pilgrim leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony and a passenger on the Mayflower ship; Martha Wadsworth Brewster (1710-1757) a notable 18th-century American poet and writer, and the Rev. Reuben Gaylord (1812-1880), a clergyman and a founder of Grinnell College.\n\nRobert liked handicraft from his childhood. In the summer of 1940, he, who was then 12, built a boy-sized aircraft with his brother Gaylord, which they used to fly from the roof of the Grinnell College stables. Later he built a radio from scratch and motorized his sled by welding a propeller and an engine from an old washing machine to the back of it. He filled a scrapbook with Popular Science plans for constructing various ship models, a bed, a contraption that worked like a windsurfer, but was used on ice, a skate sharpener, a xylophone, and a “half-horsepower sidewalk roadster”, etc.\n\nRobert entered Grinnell College after his brothers, who set a blistering academic pace. Both Don and Gaylord were extraordinary students. Robert exhibited while there an almost baffling amount of confidence. He was always the leader of the crowd, mischievous and wild. He worked beginning in very early adolescence, throwing the local newspaper, at a flower shop, where he arranged flowers and corsages, or at the post office, where he delivered special orders on his bike. He developed a flat-rate annual snow shoveling contract that he would offer his neighbors—and then he would hope for mild weather. These jobs were his primary source of spending money. He later said he felt no particular deprivation as a child, but finances were tight in the Noyce household, because Ralph was sickly.\n\nWhile in college, Noyce attended a physics course of the professor Grant Gale and was fascinated by the physics. Gale got hold of two of the very first transistors ever to come out of Bell Labs. Gale showed them off to his class and Noyce was hooked. At the same time however, Bob had problems, because of his intractable nature. His tipping outhouses, lighting illegal fireworks were harmless, but when he and a partner in crime downed a few drinks and set off to steal the pig for the luau, this was a different matter entirely. When Noyce and his housemate repented and returned to the farm with an offer to pay for the pig, whose absence had not yet been noticed, the farmer was furious and complained to the Grinnell College president Stevens, who was in a frenzy. Robert\'s last year in the college were suspended and in 1948 he was exiled not only from the college, but from the town of Grinnell as well.\n\nRobert decided to spend his semester’s expulsion working as a clerk in the actuarial department of the Equitable Life Insurance Company in Manhattan. He return to Grinnell and graduate with his class in the spring of 1949. He graduated from Grinnell College with a double major in math and physics and a Phi Beta Kappa key. He also received a signal honor from his classmates: the Brown Derby Prize, which recognized “the senior man who earned the best grades with the least amount of work”.\nThen he tried to join the air force, but when he learned he could not serve as a fighter pilot, because he was color blind, he swore to avoid military service all together. Grant Gale wrote to suggest he apply to the doctoral program in physics at MIT. Noyce did.\n\nThe decision to attend MIT was an enormous gamble for Noyce, because he could not afford it, it was too expensive for his family. He managed however to impress so much the Physics Department powers-that-be, that within a year they would give him a research fellowship that not only covered tuition but also paid $122.50 every month.\n\nBy the summer of 1953, while his dissertation (to measure the presence of electrons at the surface of quartz and magnesium oxide) was nearly finished, his knowledge and skills attracted offers to conduct research at Bell Labs at a starting salary of $7,500. IBM offered him a similar research position at $7,300 annual pay. Noyce spurned both these prestigious offers to accept a job at Philco, a Philadelphia-based company best known as a manufacturer of radios and televisions, for $6,900. After making transistors for Philco for more that 2 years, in the beginning od 1956 Noyce was contacted by William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor. He wanted Noyce to work for him—in California, for his company Shockley Semiconductor.\n\nNoyce didn\'t miss the chance to realize one of his dreams—to come to California, and the great chance to work for the famous Shockley. There he was able to demonstrate his talent not only as a brilliant scientist, but also as a team leader and administrator. In the summer of 1956 Noyce formulated an important concept, that quantum mechanics—“tunneling”, which existed only as a theoretical postulate—could be demonstrated in a simple P-N junction. Noyce brought his lab book entry to Shockley, fully expecting him to be impressed. Instead, “the boss showed no interest in the idea.” On January 15, 1958, almost exactly 17 months after Noyce noted his ideas, a Japanese scientist named Leo Esaki published an article in the prestigious Physical Review, describing the same negative resistance diode. The article caused quite a sensation in the electronics community. Noyce was irritated, primarily with himself for not pursuing his ideas even after Shockley dismissed them. “If I had gone one step further,” he told his friend Moore, “I would have done it.” In 1973, Leo Esaki shared the Nobel Prize for physics for his work on the negative-resistance, or tunnel, diode.\n\nAs it was, Shockley and Noyce\'s scientific vision and egos soon clashed. When seven of the young researchers at Shockley Semiconductor (one of them was Gordon Moore) got together to consider leaving the company, they realized they needed a leader. All seven extremely bright young men thought Noyce, the technical leader and full of confidence man, was the natural choice. So Noyce became the eighth in the group that left Shockley in September, 1957 and founded Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation, using the venture capital and the name of Sherman Fairchild—the largest shareholder in IBM.\n\nNoyce at FairchildNoyce was asked to serve as general manager of the new company, but he prefer heading R&D department. The new company proved to be a success, in contrast of many other starting semiconductor companies. The first years of Fairchild Semiconductor undoubtedly ranks as the most intellectually fertile time of Noyce’s life. Seven of his 17 patents, including his most important, for the integrated circuit, date from the 18 months after the company was launched. In 1959 he became a general manager yet, but in Fairchild\'s, as well as in the other managerial positions, he was rather unusual boss. He encouraged a casual atmosphere, he listen to his people, he would stop to talk to anyone about anything and knew many details of his employees’ personal lives.\n\nIn 1968 Fairchild Semiconductor became one of the giants in the semiconductor industry, with ten thousand employees and held some 80 percent of the computer market for integrated circuits. The situation in the company however worsened, and Noyce decided to leave and to launch his own new venture, together with his friend from Shockley Semiconductor and co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor—Gordon Moore. It was clear, that Noyce was highly creative technical person, and perfect leader as a head of R&D, but not so good as a manager of huge and multifaceted organization.\n\nNoyce and Moore officially incorporated NM Electronics in July, 1968, but soon the name was changed to Intel. Noyce’s leadership of Intel—six years as president, five as board chair, and nine as a director—helped create a company that was roughly twice as profitable as its competitors and that today stands as the largest producer of semiconductor chips in the world.\nIntel\'s first money making product was the 3101 Schottky bipolar 64-bit static random access memory (SRAM) chip, introduced in May 1969. The market hit however, which made Intel the present giant, was so called \"of the most important inventions of the twentieth century\", the first single-chip microprocessor in the world, which was manufactured namely by Intel in 1971.\n\nThe founders of Intel\nThe founders of Intel posing with a rubylith of the 8080 CPU in 1978.

SEMATECH is the American answer to a most modern challenge. After successful running of the new venture however, Noyce died from heart failure on June 3, 1990, in Austin, Texas.\n\nNoyce was a holder of many honors and awards. President Reagan awarded him the National Medal of Technology in 1987. Two years later, George H.W. Bush inducted him into the Business Hall of Fame. In February 1990, Noyce and Jack Kilby shared the first Charles Stark Draper Award—the so-called Nobel Prize of Engineering—for their work on the integrated circuit. President George H. W. Bush presented the award, sponsored by the National Academy of Engineering, in a black-tie ceremony held at the State Department. In 1990 also Noyce—along with Jack Kilby, transistor inventor John Bardeen, and some other celebrities, received a “Lifetime Achievement Medal” during the bicentennial celebration of the Patent Act.\n\nIn 1953 Robert married to Betty Bottomley, a woman of raw energy, impulsivity, and strength of will, she was every inch Bob Noyce’s equal. They had four children together—William, Pendred, Priscilla and Margaret. The couple divorced in 1974. Later in 1974 Noyce married to Ann Bowers—the first Director of Personnel for Intel Corporation and the first Vice President of Human Resources for Apple Inc.\n\nActive all his life, Noyce enjoyed reading Hemingway, flying his own airplane, hang gliding, skiing, swimming and scuba diving.'),(14,'Robert Noyce','admin','2016-08-15 11:53:56','2016-08-15 11:53:56','Bob Noyce\'s nickname was the \"Mayor of Silicon Valley.\"','Bob Noyce\'s nickname was the \"Mayor of Silicon Valley.\"   He was one of the very first scientists to work in the area -- long before the stretch of California had earned the Silicon name -- and he ran two of the companies that had the greatest impact on the silicon industry: Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel.  He also invented the integrated chip, one of the stepping stones along the way to the microprocessors in today\'s computers. \n\nNoyce, the son of a preacher, grew up in Grinnell, Iowa. He was a physics major at Grinnell College, and exhibited while there an almost baffling amount of confidence.  He was always the leader of the crowd.  This could turn against him occasionally -- the local farmers didn\'t approve of him and weren\'t likely to forgive quickly when he did something like steal a pig for a college luau.  The prank nearly got Noyce expelled, even though the only reason the farmer knew about it was because Noyce had confessed and offered to pay for it. \n\nWhile in college, Noyce\'s physics professor Grant Gale got hold of two of the very first transistors ever to come out of Bell Labs.  Gale showed them off to his class and Noyce was hooked.  The field was young, though, so when Noyce went to MIT in 1948 for his Ph.D., he found he knew more about transistors than many of his professors. \n\nAfter a brief stint making transistors for the electronics firm Philco, Noyce decided he wanted to work at Shockley Semiconductor.  In a single day, he flew with his wife and two kids to California, bought a house, and went to visit Shockley to ask for a job -- in that order. \n\nAs it was, Shockley and Noyce\'s scientific vision -- and egos -- clashed.  When seven of the young researchers at Shockley semiconductor got together to consider leaving the company, they realized they needed a leader.  All seven thought Noyce, aged 29 but full of confidence, was the natural choice.  So Noyce became the eighth in the group that left Shockley in 1957 and founded Fairchild Semiconductor. \n\nNoyce was the general manager of the company and while there invented the integrated chip -- a chip of silicon with many transistors all etched into it at once. That was the first time he revolutionized the semiconductor industry.  He stayed with Fairchild until 1968, when he left with Gordon Moore to found Intel.  At Intel he oversaw Ted Hoff\'s invention of the microprocessor -- that was his second revolution. \n\nAt both companies, Noyce introduced a very casual working atmosphere, the kind of atmosphere that has become a cultural stereotype of how California companies work.  But along with that open atmosphere came responsibility.  Noyce learned from Shockley\'s mistakes and he gave his young, bright employees phenomenal room to accomplish what they wished, in many ways defining the Silicon Valley working style was his third revolution.\n\nNoyce died of heart failure in 1990, at the age of 62. \n\nResources:  \n-- Crystal Fire by Michael Riordan and Lillian Hoddeson   \n-- Tom Wolfe. \"The Tinkerings of Robert Noyce: How the Sun Rose on the Silicon Valley.\"  Esquire.');
